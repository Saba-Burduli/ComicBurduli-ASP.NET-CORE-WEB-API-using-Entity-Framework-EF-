Here’s a quick breakdown of what I’ve done:

# Sales Management System

## Description
This is a **Sales Management System** built using **ASP.NET Web API** and **Entity Framework**. It provides RESTful APIs to manage sales, products, and customers. The system is designed to streamline sales operations and provide a centralized platform for managing sales data.


## Features 
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete sales, products, and customers.
- **RESTful API**: Fully functional API endpoints for managing data.
- **Database Integration**: Uses **MSSQL** for data storage.
- **Entity Framework**: ORM for database operations and migrations.
- **Swagger Documentation**: Interactive API documentation.



Key Roles of ASP.NET Web API in the Project:
Handling HTTP Requests:

The API processes client requests using different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to perform CRUD operations efficiently.
Controller-Based Architecture:

The system is designed with multiple controllers, each responsible for specific entities (e.g., SalesController, CustomerController, ProductController).
This separation ensures maintainability, scalability, and modularity in the application.
Business Logic Implementation:

Controllers handle business logic, ensuring proper validation and data processing before interacting with the database.
Custom logic can be applied for features like discounts, tax calculations, or stock management.
Entity Framework Integration:

ASP.NET Web API interacts with Entity Framework (EF) to manage database operations seamlessly.
EF simplifies querying, updating, and maintaining database entities using MSSQL.
Security & Authentication:

The API can be secured using authentication mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth to protect sensitive sales data.
Scalability & Extensibility:

The API is designed to support future enhancements, such as integrating third-party services, mobile apps, or external reporting tools.
RESTful Design for Flexibility:

Following REST principles ensures that the system can be consumed by any client (e.g., web apps, mobile apps, or third-party services).




Steps to Improve and Finalize My Project
**1. Organize Code**
project follows a clean architecture (e.g., Repository Pattern or Service Layer Pattern).

Separate concerns like:

Controllers: Handle HTTP requests.

Services: Business logic.

Repositories: Database operations.

Models/Entities: Database schema.

**Example structure:**

SalesManagementAPI/
├── Controllers/
├── Services/
├── Repositories/
├── Models/
├── Migrations/
├── appsettings.json
├── Program.cs
└── README.md

**2. Entity Framework Migrations**
migrations are up-to-date and applied to the database:


dotnet ef migrations add <MigrationName>
dotnet ef database update
Verify that your database schema matches your entities.

**3. API Documentation**
Use Swagger to document your API endpoints.

Add Swagger to your project:

builder.Services.AddSwaggerGen();
app.UseSwagger();
app.UseSwaggerUI();
Access Swagger UI at /swagger when running your API.


## Technologies Used
- **Backend**: ASP.NET Web API
- **Database**: MSSQL
- **ORM**: Entity Framework Core
- **Tools**: Visual Studio, Swagger, Git
